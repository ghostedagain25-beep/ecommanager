# AI AGENT SYSTEM GUIDE (PRIVATE - DO NOT COMMIT)
# ================================================

## SYSTEM OVERVIEW
This project uses a private instruction system to guide AI agents while keeping the guidance confidential.

## FILE STRUCTURE
- `AI_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.txt` - Main instruction file (comprehensive)
- `.ai-agent-trigger` - Trigger file to alert agents
- `.ai-system-guide` - This guide (for human maintainers)
- `docs/README_TEMPLATE.md` - Template for documentation

## HOW IT WORKS
1. AI agents notice the trigger file or instruction file in project root
2. They read the comprehensive instructions before making changes
3. They follow established patterns without revealing the instruction system
4. They update documentation as required
5. All instruction files remain private (in .gitignore)

## MAINTAINING THE SYSTEM

### When to Update Instructions:
- New architectural patterns are established
- New security requirements are added
- New development workflows are created
- Common issues are discovered and solved
- New tools or technologies are adopted

### How to Update Instructions:
1. Edit `AI_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.txt`
2. Add new patterns to appropriate sections
3. Update troubleshooting section with new issues
4. Update changelog at bottom of file
5. Test with new AI agent to ensure clarity

### Keeping It Confidential:
- Never mention instruction files in public commits
- Use generic language like "following established patterns"
- Keep all instruction files in .gitignore
- Train team members on the system
- Regular review of public documentation to ensure no leaks

## DOCUMENTATION WORKFLOW

### For Human Developers:
1. Follow normal development practices
2. Update public README files as usual
3. Maintain instruction files when patterns change
4. Review AI agent work to ensure compliance

### For AI Agents:
1. Must read instructions before any work
2. Must update public documentation
3. Must follow established patterns
4. Must not reference private instruction system

## BENEFITS
- Consistent development patterns across all AI assistance
- Comprehensive guidance without cluttering public docs
- Maintains project confidentiality
- Reduces onboarding time for new AI agents
- Ensures documentation stays current

## MONITORING
- Regularly review AI agent work for compliance
- Check that documentation is being updated
- Verify patterns are being followed
- Update instructions based on common issues

## BACKUP STRATEGY
- Keep instruction files backed up separately
- Version control for instruction files (private repo)
- Regular reviews and updates
- Team knowledge sharing
